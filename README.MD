# Manufacturing Tycoon

You are the manufacturer of consumer toasters, and you must
manage your resources so as to grow your buisness and make
money!!!!!

# Overview

## Asset types:

money
factories
inventory (goods already manufactured)

You sell as many units as there is demand. The
higher you raise your price, the less demand
there is.

You may advertise to increase demand.

You may borrow money for 2 percent interest (truncated down),
which you pay per turn (of money which has not
been payed back yet). You may go bankrupt if
you lose all your funds and cannot pay interest.

You start out with an asset of 1 million and one
factory.

Each unit costs $5.00 to produce, so you must price
accordingly.

Factories can produce 100 units per turn.


# Random Thoughts

D = 100 + ads + growth+-


ads = (dollars\demand last turn)\2


growth= -ads last turn\2 + 20 each turn



maybe depressions (negative constant above)
